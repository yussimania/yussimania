            As a frequent player of Apex Legends and a competitive quake player I have some really good tips to share with everyone reading this guide. If you have played
            TitanFall 2, you will find the core game runs very similar. However some changes have been made such as the loss of the ability to wallride. Instead we get to scale buildings
            a few metres before descending. Lets get right into some tips i have comprised.

  <div class="container-fluid bk2">
    <div class="content-2">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-1"></div>
        <div class="col-md-6">

          <h3 class="m-3">Landing spots</h3>
          <p class="m-3">
            In the beginning of every match, a Hot Zone will be marked on the map by a large blue circle. Throughout this highlighted area, players will find that there is an increased chance of receiving higher tiered armor, as well as decked out
            weapons that are complete with all attachments.
            Given that every player in the match sees Hot Zones, you can only imagine just how intense this area can get, especially when it is close to the beginning of the flight path.
            If you're lucky and the zone isn't directly along the flight path, there is a much higher chance that players will just bypass the zone in favor of another area.
            Hot Zones can be very risky, but if your willing to battle it out with many other players, the chances are you will be highly rewarded.
          </p>
          <p class="m-3">
            If you're looking to loot in peace, the Thunderdome is going to be one of your best bets.
            Thunderdome has often been one of my favorite go-to areas to drop at because you will rarely ever encounter a fight during the opening minutes of the match.
            While the area isn't exactly massive, it will have enough loot for your entire team. Once your team is decked out and ready, Skull Town is a great option to move on as you will often find at least one team in the area - making it an
            ideal opportunity to launch a surprise attack on the unsuspecting players.
          </p>


          <p class="m-3">
            Unique to Apex Legends, players have the opportunity to loot from the Supply Ship - the best initial looting spot available in Kings Canyon.
            The Supply Ship, much like Hot Zones, will be marked on the map for all players see and will travel across the map until it reaches a marked destination. Here the ship will deploy zip-lines that can be used to travel upwards towards the
            ship.
            If you're lucky, you may even have the opportunity to land on top of the Supply Ship if your flight path is nearby. More often then not, the ship will be the fastest way to deck out your entire team and will beat out other areas in terms
            of loot quality and rare items.
            However, it is arguably one of the most intense dropping situations you will ever encounter and will usually see upwards of two or more teams landing on the small ship, so prepare for a rather hectic battle.
          </p>
          <p class="m-3">
            Located in the north-eastern corner of Kings Canyon, you will find a small area known as Relay. Much like Thunderdome, you are often left to loot in peace and will rarely find players landing in the area.
            With enough loot to satisfy your entire team, Relay is an ideal drop location as it allows players of all skill levels the opportunity to explore and learn the ropes.
          </p>
          <p class="m-3">
            While Supply Drops won't necessarily be available right off the bat, they do happen to be a great way to pick up rare loot. Working in the same way as Fortnite, you will find these randomly dropping from the sky throughout the match.
            The chances are though, you won't be the only player landing at the supply drop. However, it is very unlikely that these drops will attract the same level of attention that is seen at the Supply Ship and Hot Zones.
            Before you go rushing into the drop zone, it is worth your while to scope out your surroundings and ensure that you aren't going to be ambushed by other players.

          <h2 class="cent1">Best weapons</h2>
          <p class="bwep">
            Picking up the right weapon when you drop into Apex Legends can tremendously change the outcome of your game. This Apex Legends Weapon rank is where I share my thoughts on the best weapons to use in every class, including favourites from
            the community.
          </p>

          <h3 class="cent2"><u>Pistols</u></h3>
          <h4>Wingman</h4>
          <p>When compared to other pistols in the category, the Wingman is the clear winner among the group. With the ability to blast through opponents with a 45 damage to the body, there is no doubting that the Wingman single shot pistol can
            deliver significant amounts of damage -- especially when paired with the Skullpiercer Rifling attachment.
            However, its slow firing capabilities and rather low accuracy makes those desired head shots just that much more challenging to achieve.
            With a steady hand, those that choose to master the Wingman pistol will be well on their way to victory.</p>
          <h3 class="cent2"> <u>Shotguns</u></h3>
          <h4>Mastiff Shotgun</h4>
          <p>Despite being extremely rare and only firing unique ammunition that cannot be replenished, the Mastiff Shotgun boasts some of the best weapon stats in the game. With an insane kickback due to the sheer power of the weapon, the Mastiff
            will smash your opponents to crumbs if they dare come too close.
            If you have managed to get your hands on this lucrative weapon (try looking in supply drops for the legendary Mastiff), you will be surprised just how capable it is of reaching close to mid-range targets.
            With the ability to deal 288 damage in a single shot, the four round weapon can easily clear an entire room with ease when placed into the right hands.</p>
          <h4>Peacekeeper</h4>
          <p>If you can't get your hands on the much sought after Mastiff, the Peacekeeper is by far your next best option in the shotgun category. With great all round stats, the Peacekeeper is one of the best weapons currently in the game.
            When paired with the Precision Choke Hop-Up, you will have the ability to hold down the aim button and charge up your shots. This allows you to fire a much closer spread, making the damage even more lethal to your opponents.</p>
          <h3 class="cent2"><u>Assault Rifles</u></h3>
          <h4>VK-47 Flatline</h4>
          <p>The full-automatic VK-47 Flatline deals some of the highest damage in the AR category.
            Featuring impressive accuracy and stability, the weapon thrives in medium to long range encounters due to its relatively high fire-rate and minimal recoil. With little faults, it's no wonder that the VK-47 Flatline is a favorite amongst
            many in the community.</p>
          <h4>R-301</h4>
          <p>If getting your hands on a Flatline isn't possible, an R-301 will make for a perfect substitute, as the high precision Assault Rifle can be extremely powerful when completely decked out with attachments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm second">

          <h3><u>Sub Machine Guns</u></h3>
          <h4>Prowler Burst PDW</h4>
          <p>This 5-round burst SMG not only features an insanely fast fire rate, but it also has the highest damage capabilities in the SMG category.
            When placed into the right hands, the Prowler can deal some very significant damage. This is especially true when fitted with extended mags, a nice scope, and the Selectfire Receiver Hop-Up which will allow the weapon to act just like
            any other SMG.
            Topping the SMG category, this P90 style SMG is an easy choice for those looking for the perfect close quarter weapon.</p>
          <h3><u>Light Machine Guns</u></h3>
          <h4>M600 Spitfire</h4>
          <p>Despite the Devotion being a favorite amongst the community, the M600 Spitfire is arguably the most practical machine gun out of the two. With an accuracy and fire rate that's hard match and relatively decent damage, the M600 Spitfire
            has the capability of destroying your opponents.
            Although the Devotion is a favorite amongst the community and has the upper hand when it comes to damage, the weapon unfortunately has too many downfalls when compared the full-automatic capabilities of the M600 Spitfire.
            <h3><u>Sniper Rifles</u></h3>
            <h4>Kraber .50-Cal Sniper</h4>
            <p>Much like the Mastiff shotgun, the legendary Kraber .50-CAL Sniper is extremely rare and is the only other weapon to use a unique ammo type that cannot be replenished.
              This powerful bolt-action style sniper rifle dealings one of the most fatal body shots in the game. While headshots with the .50-CAL Rifle can take down enemies in one single shot regardless of their shield and health levels. If you
              manage to get your hands on this weapon, it's safe to assume that it's game over for many players, especially if you know how to use snipers correctly.</p>

            <h4>G7 Scout</h4>
            <p>Despite popular opinion, the G7 Scout is one of the more versatile Snipers Rifles in the category, as the semi-automatic rifle can be used in a number of different situations.
              When decked out with attachments, the G7 Scout boasts decent damage capabilities, solid accuracy, and a relatively fast fire rate for a Sniper Rifle.
              While it comes down to personal preference, I've found that the G7 Scout pairs well with the VK-47 Flatline.

      <div class="col-md-12 cent1">
        <h2 class="cent1">Legends</h2>
        <p class="m-3"> In Apex Legends, there is a roster of different heros with unique specialities. Each hero has a different abillity which can be useful in different scenarios. Here is my personal list of
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <h3 class="cent1">Mirage</h3>
        <img src="./images/Apex_Mirage.jpg" alt="Apex Mirage" style='max-width: 300px'/>
        <p>The master of decoy, Mirage can send a decoy out every 14 seconds. In addition, when downed, he turns invisible and also creates a decoy of himself. His ultimate ability turns him invisible while creating multiple copies of Mirage.</p>
        <h3 class="cent1">Bangalore</h3>
        <img src="./images/Apex_Bangalore.jpg" alt="Bangalore" style='max-width: 300px'>
        <p>Bangalore moves faster when under fire, making her harder to kill while she escapes or strafes in combat. Her ultimate lets her fire two smoke grenades and her ultimate calls in an artillery strike that rolls across the map.</p>

        <h3 class="cent1">Caustic</h3>
        <img src="./images/Apex_Caustic.jpg" alt="Caustic" style='max-width: 300px'/>
       <p>Caustic is a sociopath and can place gas traps that are great for rigging rooms and fortifying choke points. His ultimate lets you throw a gas grenade that covers a large area with poison And his passive lets you see any enemies within that cloud allowing you to finish them off while they’re being slowed and disoriented.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <h3 class="cent1">Pathfinder</h3>
        <img src="./images/Apex_Pathfinder.jpg" alt="Pathfinder" style='max-width: 300px'/>
        <p>Pathfinder has a grapple that you can use to whip yourself around the map and get high ground quickly. You can even use it to pull enemies toward you for a shotgun finish. Pathfinder can hack certain beacons around the map to give you and your team intel on where the next safe circle will be and his ultimate gives him the ability to create a zipline,
         useful for traversing across the map.</P>
         <h3 class="cent1">BloodHound</h3>
         <img src="./images/Apex_BloodHound.jpg" alt="BloodHound" style='max-width: 300px'/>
         <p>Bloodhound’s passive lets you pick up on enemy cues such as footprints and if they took damage. The tactical ability sends out a pulse wave that briefly notifies you and your teammates of enemies and traps if they are in proximity. Bloodhound’s ultimate highlights enemies red, makes their footprints red, and makes the player much faster.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3">

        <h3 class="cent1">Gibraltar</h3>
        <img src="./images/Apex_Gibraltar.jpg" alt="Gibraltar" style='max-width: 300px'/>
        <p>Gibraltar is all about team support with his bubble dome that can protect while in a fight or while looting but he also has offensive abilities that work well with the flow of combat. His passive gives him a shield while aiming down sights which gives him an initial advantage in a straight up gun fight. His ultimate is a mortar strike that lasts for a long duration of time, destroying any enemy that stays in the area – unless they hide under cover of course.</p>
        <h3>Respawn Beacons</h2>
          <img src="./images/Apex_Respawn.jpg" alt="Respawn Beacon" style='max-width: 300px'/>
        <p>Just because a player has been eliminated in combat, doesn't mean that they are dead for the entire match. Unlike other battle royale games, Respawn has introduced a unique recovering system that gives players 90 seconds to grab their fallen teammates banner before it expires. If you fail to retrieve this banner within the given time frame, the player will be officially eliminated from the match and willl have to spectate.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <h3 class="cent1">Wraith</h3>
        <img src="./images/Apex_Wraith.jpg" alt="Wraith" style='max-width: 300px'/>
        <p>Wraith is a soldier who uses the void for all three of her abilities. Her passive gives you extremely useful audio cues when traps are near or if enemies are aiming at you. Her tactical turns you invisible for a short period of time but you additionally become immune to all damage including the encroaching circle. Her ultimate, Dimensional Rift, allows Wraith to form two portals that either ally or foe can use to teleport across.</p>

        <h3 class="cent1">Lifeline</h3>
        <img src="./images/Apex_Lifeline.jpg" alt="Lifeline" style='max-width: 300px'/>
        <p>Lifeline’s passive ability gives her a shield while reviving knocked down allies. Healing items are also used 25% faster. In a game where the combat is as aggressive as it is in Apex Legends, faster healing, and shields while reviving allies allows you to mitigate some of the disadvantages you would normally encounter while being injured or outnumbered. Her tactical ability drops a drone that heals anyone on your team over time, allowing everyone to save their syringes and fight while being healed. Her ultimate takes the longest time to charge out of all the legends but that’s because it’s a care package that drops with high rarity gear including the mastiff and the kraber sniper rifle.</p>
